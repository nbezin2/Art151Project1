Colors:
The colors change based on the position of the circle. The further right increases the Red color, the further down increases the Green color
and the position of you mouse the closer you get to the bottom right corner adds more Blue color.

Speed and Direction of circles:
The mouse influences the direction of the circle. When you bring the mouse to the right side of the canvas you will increase the speed in the
x-axis and when you bring the mouse further down you will increase the speed in the y-axis.

Left Clicking:
This will reset the canvas so you can start a new drawing.

Play around and enjoy!
